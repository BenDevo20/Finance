Risks affecting equity options
1. price risk - relates to uncertain changes in the underlying price
2. vol risk - vol refers to the standard deviation of the underlying returns - vol is stochastic
3. interest rate risk - the underlying value is indirectly influenced by interest rates
4. correlation risk - if you own multiple options contracts, they may move closer to 1, indicating that
you are holding two contracts that move together, which carries more risk
5. liquidity risk - dynamic and static hedging depend on market liquidity

"""
volatility 
1. instantaneous volatility - vol factor of a diffusion process - in black scholes is the differential equation of the 
risk neutral rate 
3. implied volatility - gives the market observed price of an option - sometimes the variance is modeled - which is the 
squared counter-part of the vol 
4. skewness - measure of the location of sample values relative to the mean 
5. kurtois - measure for the peakedness of a distribution and/or size of the trails of the distro
